## SUMMARY:
In this lab, we created a string library linked to the code provided in the main.py. Using string features described in the lab description, I was able to complete the first four methods and have the expected results match up with the actual results.

## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: 2

Grace days remaining: 3/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
I was not able to complete the def cipher(self): portion of the lab, as I had some code, but because it did not run, I removed it so I did not get a zero on the lab. 

## REFERENCES:
I used the source below for help in condenscing my asciiSum portion of the lab into a single line of code. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12492137/python-sum-of-ascii-values-of-all-characters-in-a-string)

 I used this source as a means to enhance my knowledge on the index feature, which I used in the def fixStart(self): portion of the lab

Additionally, I used the Python library, Google doc lab description and the two embedded links provided by Professor Moore, which I will list below.
